![](/images/news/News_Events eAdviser launch.jpg)

GoBusiness has launched the [Guide for Organising Events](/gobiz-guides/guide-for-organising-events/?src=news){:target="_blank"}, a new events page to provide organisers with tools to navigate the process of organsing events in Singapore such as e-Adviser for Events and Event Proposal Drop.

### How does Events Proposal Drop work?

The Event Proposal Drop allows event organisers to propose unique event concepts for collaboration with the government, or seek government endorsements for regulatory approvals. Currently, only proposals for MICE, Sports and Fitness events are accepted.
